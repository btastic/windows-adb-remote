windows-adb-remote
==================
A simple console application which allows to connect via adb to an android device and send via "adb input keyevents <id>" different inputs.

Keys that are mapped:
Enter -> Enter/Select
Backspace -> Back
Escape -> Menu
A-Z + 1-0 -> Normal Keyboard Keys
Comma -> ,
Period -> .

F5 -> Back to Menu

This is not a remote for everyday usage, since its very slow (adb). I just made this small program, because I forgot my Amazon Fire TV Remote, when I was at my girlfriends house.
